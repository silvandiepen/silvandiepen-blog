# The restarting Samsung TV

Some years ago (around 8) I bought a new Samsung TV, full HD and with 3D support. No smart tv, just dumb and actually by choice. 
A TV for me is just a screen, it shouldnt do anything smart, since computers age a lot harder than screens, I prefered a dumb TV. 

The TV has been working for a long time but around 2 years ago it suddenly started rebooting. At first it did and I didn't think much of it. The TV started doing that more and more regularly until the point it was just restarting continuously. It was unbearable and I started looking up how to get it fixed, while also researching to buy a new TV.

A solution which came by most was to just send the TV to Samsung and let them repair it, but that would mean I have to pay for all shipping, the initial investigation costs and eventually the repairing costs. Which will all add up and result in a bill higher than just buying a new TV. 

Eventually I found a thread about restarting Samsung TVs, not sure where anymore but someone suggested putting the whole TV in the freezer. It sounded odd and I for sure don't have a freezer big enough to fit a 42" panel. So, since I figured the screen itself was ok, it should have been in the chipset, I opened up the TV and just frooze the chipsets found in the TV for about an hour. Ofcourse I packed them in plastic before doing so.

After this, put the TV back together and started it up. The TV stayed on and didnt restart the whole night. It was fixed!

Until about a week ago, the TV was fine and worked like it should, but started having the same problem. So again, took the chipsets out and frooze them for an hour. The TV is been working properly again for now! Let's see how long it will last now.
