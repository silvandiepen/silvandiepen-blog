# Don’t do this to your user

Every website is different, which is a good thing. But there are certain best practices which arent obligated, but it would be good if you would at least consider them. There are a few things which I think are really annoying while browsing the website. Here is a little list.. 

## 1. Hijack scrolling

I expect my devices to do certain things, like the way my phone scrolls is made very intuitive. Hijacking this makes it feel like my phone is broken or if there is something wrong. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mean animations on scroll or things happening, hiding and appearing on scroll(directions), they can be very helpful. No, actually hijacking the scroll functionality. You might like it as a developer, but for the biggest part of the users it just feels weird and unintuitive which gives a bad feeling to a website. It makes the website feel sluggish or weird, those aren’t things you want the user to feel about your website. Unless you do, than just do it, but don’t complain. 

## 2. Multi level sign-in forms

Logging in is already as hassle, making this a multi-level process is very unnecessary. Many autofill solutions dont even recognize the forms or it will take you even more clicks to just get through. Please don’t making logging in a hassle, it should just work.

## 3. Two times the email

Signing up anywhere used to be a whole process, filling in an email address twice makes it even more annoying, especially when you can’t autofill. Which then again, if you can, makes filling it in twice defeat its purpose of being sure you filled in the right email address. Instead, make me just fill in my email and make it possible to change it in the end of the process when an email has been send. If it doesn’t get through, you can still change it. Also most people know how to type their own email, biggest mistakes made anyway will be in the domain, which can easily be checked in other ways, typing it twice doesn’t make sense.

## 4. Endless scrolling without permission

The footer in the website is expected as the source of certain links like contact information or opening times. By giving the user an instance endless scroll on articles the access to the footer is blocked. 

This can be easily fixed by just giving a limited amount of articles with a clear button under suggestion to (unlimited) show more. In this way, users who don’t care about the full list can just have a normal experience and other users can opt-in to go for the full list. 

## 5. Blocking blockers

I understand that we all want to make money, but blocking your full website with blocking add blockers probably makes you loose more money than without. Users have a certain respect for your website, but when a user blocks adds for a reason and had to unblock this, for you. That respect is lost. 

You could instead give a warning, a popup or just a banner in your website. Which is annoying enough already. If I like your website, I might turn it off, as long as the adds are not too intrusive. Having to turn it off to start with is asking your date to come home with you before you even talked first. 

## 6. Not using the right input type

While on desktop this can be easily forgotten, while filling in a form on mobile it’s very handy to be able to use the autofill functionality of your browser. As a developer you don’t even have to do more than just use the right input types. Filling in my email address while I could just click on autofill suggestion to give it in is really annoying and makes me in many cases just want to forget about that website. If the right input type is already too hard...

## 7. Disrespecting accessibility

Accessibility is not just making your website accessible to disabled people (which shouldn’t be abandoned neither) but also for people without disabilities. Every user has different ways and methods to browse the website. Being able to tab through a website or just selecting something in a normal way in a select field aren’t rare things. 

## 8. Mobile navigation on desktop websites

A desktop is big enough to show full navigation. So please show it. If you think, it’s ugly, hire a better designer. 

## 9. Full blown cookie modals

Cookies exist, most websites use them and with or without, we will be tracked. I’m not a fan of it, but it’s the reality we live in. The European union thought it would be a good idea to make websites ask for permissions to use any data. Which, in idea isn’t that bad but in real life, people just click ok. It’s like having to agree with terms and conditions. Legal bullshit nobody actually reads. 

I understand they are necessary for some reason, but please keep them small, short and easy to get rid of. Just say what you want to and don’t make it a complete book with a lot of possibilities.

## 10. Hide Contact information

Especially bigger companies have the tendency to make users search for contact information. This should be a crucial thing for a website, the ability to find a phone number or e-mail address to contact a service. Especially when it’s a service clients pay for. Don’t make me have to google and find the phone number of a service on another website because the company itself tries to hide it as far away as possible.
