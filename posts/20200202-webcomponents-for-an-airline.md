# Using Web Components for an airline.

About a month ago I started working at a team for a Dutch airline. They are currently running their website completely in a sitecore environment. Obviously, this is not ideal. Sitecore might be a good product, it also holds back technology and it takes a long time to implement new things. That's why they started planning working on a completely new website, trying to get the current website to a new stack partially and gradually is not really an option. Or atleast not a good option.

So, some of my team members started working on some little prototypes. They chose NextJS to be the new framework to build the new website on top of. Would this be my choice? Probably not, but thats just because I'm biased with Vue, considering the choice coming from React, I do understand it.
