# I don't believe in Full-stack

Just as much I believe a person can like any fruit the same amount, I believe a Full-stack developer can actually exist. I once said;

> The fullstack developer; Knows about everything, but thrives at nothing. 

But in this case I actually believe a full-stack developer exists. I don't anymore. 

### But let's go into what a "full-stack developer is.

To understand, we should explain also a frontend and backend are. According to [skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/blog/front-end-back-end-full-stack/);

- front end development (the visible parts of a website or app)
- back end development (the “under the hood” databases and infrastructure)
- full stack development (a hybrid of both). Full stack can apply to a web stack, mobile stack, or a native application stack (i.e. software programs for specific devices)

### To explain myself

The Full-stack developer doesn't exist. That's quite a statement, but I believe a human-being is not capable of liking anything the same amount as anything else. A developer gets best at something when there is passion and a love for a language or methodology, which means that that is something which you enjoy doing. And becoming actually good at something needs passion.

I believe somebody can have a wide knowledge of language, but you can't learn everything the same amount. There will always be a bigger passion for either frontend, backend, mobile, etc development. Even in those categories there are several sub categories.

For instance; I believe I am a frontend developer. I enjoy making nice visual things and I do have the occasional more complex things. I'm also not afraid to touch the backend or even do my share. Does that make me a full-stack developer? I don't think so. I am, what I think, a "Creative Frontend Developer". As in, I love to work on the visual aspects of frontend development. I can do the other parts, but I simply enjoy them less and prefer doing the visual things. Some people have the opposite, they are afraid of touching CSS or just prefer not to. That is not a problem, but don't call yourself a fullstack developer. The fact that you can, or understand, doesn't mean you enjoy and thus prefer doing it.

What do you think?
