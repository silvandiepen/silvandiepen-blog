# YouTube blocked my phone..

Although, not completely, it blocked my phone from doing anything, not in the regular way like putting in your password too many times.

I have no idea what happened, but when opening YouTube it got stuck on the intro/loading screen. I tried to close the app, but that gesture didn't work at all. I could get in to the lock screen, but getting into the screen to turn off my phone was impossible. So all I could do essentially was; make a picture, unlock my phone with faceID, turn on/off the light and.. Siri!

Trying to restart my phone using Siri wasn't an option tho, by just trying it, it will only tell me how "Hold the volume and lock button at the same time", blabla.. I've tried that! But That didn't work.

It took me a while and I was about to just wait it out till my battery would have died, this could take a while, because It was just charged and wasn't really doing anything. I have once put an iPhone 4 charged away and it still worked after a few months, I mean, It didn't have any connection or anything, so it hardly used any batter. But yeah, so I was a bit afraid of it taking quite some time.



### The solution

But then I thought of it, I have Siri and I can enable/disable things on my phone using Siri. I enabled "Assistive touch" by telling Siri "Enable Assistive Touch", Siri was my friend an happily enabled it. Now I got that home button in my screen which I could use. By clicking it longer, I actually got some more option. From `Device > More > Restart` I could finally restart my phone. And it did! My phone worked again..
